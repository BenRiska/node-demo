# node-demo
barebones api for receiving, storing + displaying data


behold, my first node project! lol.

just a simple api to manipulate data given through url routing.

my next goal is to create a more complex version that actually has a front end ui for people to use.

packages used - nodemon, Fs, express.

feel free to use any components in your own work.
